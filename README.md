# Robotics Project 2020 - Drone tracking
##### Contributors: Anton Vo - Einar Tomter - Saodat Mansurova

## Introduction & overview

This project uses the drone **Tello** and showcases three different object detection method (HAAR, YOLO, HSV).
The system controlling the drone is equipped with a PID-controller and Kalman filter for smoother movements and reactions.

## Features

##### On screen display (OSD)

The drone have a few sensors that we have neatly displayed on the frame captured from the video feed sent from the drone.
